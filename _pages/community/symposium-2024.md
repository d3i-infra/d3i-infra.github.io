At Data Donation Symposium 2024 we bring together applied researchers, methodologists, legal and ethical experts, research engineers and software developers with an interest in using digital trace data for scientific research purposes. 

*May 30-31st at the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands* 

#### Program

An overview of the program can be found [here](/assets/documents/ddsymposium_program.pdf).

#### Location

The symposium takes place in room REC C0.01, Roeterseilandcampus Building C in the city center of Amsterdam. See [here](https://www.uva.nl/en/shared-content/locaties/en/roeterseiland/rec-b-c-d-entrance-b-c.html) for more details on the location.

#### Keynote

We are happy to announce Melinda Mills as the keynote speaker for the symposium, where she will talk about Data4Science, a platform for individuals to take control of their own data, donate, understand it, shape their own behaviour and share it for broader health and behavioural research. 

Mills is Professor of Demography and Population Health and Director of the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University Oxford. She also holds a part-time position as Professor of Data Science and Public Health Policy, University of Groningen. Data4Science emerged out of her ERC Consolidator Grant SOCIOGENOME, ERC Advanced Grant (CHRONO) and ERC Proof of Concept Grant DNA4Science. She has written 7 books and over 150 articles, including two applied statistics books, in the areas of demography, genetics, inequality, sociology, statistics, health and policy.
