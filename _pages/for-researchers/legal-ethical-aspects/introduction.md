The promise of digital humanities and computational social science is that researchers can use digital trace data that is generated by digital platform usage to study human behavior and interaction at an unprecedented level of detail. But researchers are increasingly confronted with a paradox: while digital trace data are scaling, most data are closed off in proprietary archives of commercial corporations, with only a subset available to a small set of elite researchers at a platform’s discretion (in initiatives such as Social Science One) or via increasingly restricted and opaque APIs. 

The D3I infrastructure turns the user-platform-researcher relationship around: Instead of researchers being dependent on platforms to study individuals, D3I enables researchers to work directly with individuals to study both individuals’ own behavior and platforms themselves. This allows researchers to collect crucial data to study causes, contents, and consequences of (online) communication, behavior and cultural production, and consumption within platforms. 


D3I allows researchers to work with individuals who are willing to donate their platform usage data to academic research, creating a movement in which users and academics come together to share and make use of data rights, and to enable research to be in full compliance with participants’ rights and interests. This movement more generally aims to create participant trust in how their data are being used for scientific research purposes.
