## Getting started

When using data donation in your research, there are multiple aspects you need to prepare. Besides configuring the PORT software, you need to prepare your study design, the Python extraction script, and prepare your submission to your University's Ethical Review Board prior to starting your study. You can find more info on these steps under each tab on the left.
