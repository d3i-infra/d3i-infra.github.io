- **Principal investigators:** Sarah Marschlich
- **Summary:** This study investigates how individuals engage with organizational posts on social media and whether their user engagement with organizational posts differs depending on the social media platform (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). Moreover, this study aims to understand what role individuals' motivations to use social media in the context of organizational content and the perceived affordances (incl. platform features and properties) play in user engagement with organizational posts. The following research questions guide this study: RQ1: How do individuals make sense of their engagement with organizational content on social media through the lens of their digital trace data, and how does this differ across social media platforms? RQ2: Which motivations and perceived platform affordances are relevant in the individuals’ engagement with organizational content?
