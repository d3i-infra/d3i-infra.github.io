The ethical considerations and recommendations in the workflow (section 7) are mostly prerequisites for any study concerning human participants. However, the points raised here in the workflow aim to account for non-response error and consent error as well. Ensuring good privacy and good communication towards participants about the privacy will help in convincing participants of the message that the study procedure holds no privacy risks for participants. If this message is not conveyed clear enough, participants might drop out from the study and collected data can be biased as a result of this.

The recommendations in section 8 aim to account for integration error and compliance error. Integration error emerges when data from multiple sources about a single participant is not matched correctly. In such case, data on a single participant can be interpreted as data about multiple participants, and inferences can be biased as a result of this. As data linkage is explicitly considered and recommended when conducting a pilot study, mistakes in data linkage can be identified and taken into account, minimizing potential integration error. Furthermore, conducting a pilot study helps in identifying difficulties and errors in the participant flow. These findings can be taken into account, ensuring participants will be able to complete the participant flow. Therefore, these improvements help in minimizing the effect of compliance error on the data quality.
