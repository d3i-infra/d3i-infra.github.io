Concretizing the data donation research idea (the first step of the workflow; section 3) aims to account for construct invalidity and measurement error. Construct invalidity occurs when the collected data does not align well with the construct aimed to measure. In that case, the collected data does not measure the construct, resulting in made inferences being invalid. An example where construct invalidity potentially can be found, is in the RQ2 (WhatsApp; see section 2.3). The construct ‘responding most to’ was measured as the number of messages sent directly after another person. It can be argued that this operationalization does not take into account responses to a message that are sent with some messages in between. Therefore, construct invalidity might play a role here to a certain extend. The steps described in section 3 aim to guide the researcher in avoiding construct invalidity.

Measurement error occurs when incorrect or imprecise measurements are made. Such incorrect measurements can be biased and might lead to incorrect inferences. Incorrect measurements should be avoided, or be accounted for if they cannot be prevented. As measurements in data donation studies are mostly carried out by the platforms of interest, ensuring correct measurement is not always feasible. However, mapping allegedly incorrect measurements and accounting for these measurements is very important. In the workflow, measurement error is considered in the steps in section 3 by comprehending the DDPs of interest, and by mapping and accounting for potential limitations of platforms and DDPs of interest.
