Construction of the data donation study design (section 4) considers all five error sources from the representation side of the TE framework. Coverage error and sampling error both are relevant for any study where inferences for a population are made. Coverage error occurs when the researcher fails to include people from the target population to potentially participate in the study. If there is a systematic bias between the people not included, bias might emerge in the data. In data donation studies, coverage error can specifically emerge when the population of interest is not the same population as users of the platform of interest. For example, if for example RQ 1 (GSLH) the population of interest is the general population, this does not align perfectly with the population of people using GSLH and owning a smartphone. People without a smartphone or Google account might travel differently than people with a smartphone and Google account, resulting in potential bias in population inferences made. The recommendations in the first step of the workflow (section 3) aim to take into account a discrepancy between the population of interest and study population, and subsequently to account for coverage error. On the other hand, sampling error emerges when the researcher is unsuccessful in obtaining a representative study sample. In order to avoid both coverage error and sampling error, the proposed workflow recommends to seek advise from a methodological expert when constructing the study design. 

The other three representation errors can be linked to the participant flow. First, non-response error can arise when people decide not to participate in the study. Another term describing non-response commonly used is willingness to participate. Depending on the exact study design, it can be more or less difficult to distinguish generic non-response from non-response caused by the choice include data donation in the study design and the perception participants might have about data donation. As recommended, clear communication and insight in the privacy risks, and incentives can be used to achieve higher response rates and minimize non-response error. Furthermore, additional information on participants not participating in the donation can be used to account for non-response bias.

Second, compliance error arises when participants drop out anywhere in the participant flow as a result of being unable to follow the actions requested in the participant flow. This error could result in bias if groups being able and unable to comply differ. For example, when unclear DDP download instruction are provided, technologically proficient participants are more likely to comply than participants that do not use the internet regularly. The proposed workflow accounts for compliance error by stimulating for provision of detailed and correct instructions for each step of the participant flow, tailored towards the population and differentiated for different operational systems and devices. Other actions to account for compliance error could be including an assistance point for participants with questions and extensively testing the participant flow, for example by using cognitive interviews (Collins, 2014) to understand how participants experience the study.

Third, consent error emerges when participants decide to not donate in the last step of the participant flow. This could for example happen when the participant did not experience their privacy as guaranteed during the participant flow. Another aspect which might influence consent error, is the visualisation of the data extracted from the DDP. Visualisations might aid understanding of what information is exactly send to the researcher. If participants cannot oversee what information is exactly donated, they might tend to decline the donation, resulting in potential bias. In sections 4, 5, and 7, the privacy of participants and visualization of the data are addressed in the workflow, ensuring consent error is taken into account.

Including an additional data collection method in the study design (as described in section 4), can help in accounting for both measurement error and non-response error. By providing the opportunity to measure a construct in multiple ways (e.g. both through data donation and through a questionnaire), multiple measurements can be combined to a single measurement with multiple indicators (for example through multitrait multimethods models; Oberski et al., 2017). These measurements hold more information than measurements with a single indicator, and measurement error can be reduced by this. Furthermore, non-response error can be taken into account by collecting contextual information on participants unwilling to participate in data donation. By explaining differences between participants and non-participants through these data, missingness in data can transform from missing not at random to missing at random (van Buuren, 2018). Non-response error can then be accounted for by for example weighting (Boeschoten, Araujo, et al., 2022).
