The Total Error framework (TE framework) for data donation by Boeschoten, Araujo, et al. (2022) summarizes potential sources of error that can influence data collection. The TE framework is depicted in Figure 9. In this section, this TE framework will be explained in more detail. Then it will be discussed how our proposed workflow aligns with the TE framework. It will be illustrated that all error sources considered by the TE framework are taken into account with the proposed workflow, as illustrated in figure 10. This forms support for the steps as described in proposed workflow.

The TE framework consists of a measurement side and a representation side. The measurement side comprises error sources that are introduced by the decisions on how the constructs in the study are being measured, and consists of construct invalidity, measurement error, extraction error, algorithmic error, and integration error respectively. The representation side comprises error sources related to the target population that the data is meant to represent. It consists of coverage error, sampling error, nonresponse error, compliance error, and consent error respectively.
