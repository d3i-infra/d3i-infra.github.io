First, each construct of interest for the study should be operationalized. Additionally, the research questions can provide further specifications about the context that the constructs will be measured in. Examples for these specifications could be populations and time restrictions. For example, for the construct 'travel behaviour' in example RQ1, the specifications distinction between modes of travel, tracking over time, and commonly used in the Dutch population were identified (see Table 1). In some cases, constructs are already specific by their own definition, and no further specifications are needed or provided by the research question (see for example Step 1 in Table 2, where the construct 'Inferred interests by social media' for example RQ2 is not further delineated). Delineation of the research question facilitates choosing between relevant DDPs for the research idea.
