When a researcher plans to include data donation as a tool for data collection in their study, they should first consider the exact purpose and added value of data donation in the context of that study. Defining such purpose is mandated by the GDPR for processing of any personal data (Hoofnagle et al., 2019). In addition, the idea of using data donation in a study should be made more concrete.
The following steps can help here:

1. Operationalize constructs and delineate the research question.
2. Select candidate DDPs based on the chosen constructs.
3. Evaluate the constructs and delineated research question in light of each candidate DDP.
4. Reiterate the operationalization of the constructs in light of the DDPs.
