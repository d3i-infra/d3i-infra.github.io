Once a suited platform is selected, it can be determined what exact data from the DDP will be used to measure the constructs. This means a second iteration of operationalization of the construct\is performed, now specifically in the light of the research question. Constructs can be measured either directly or indirectly in a DDP. For an indirect construct, this means that further processing of the data from the DDP is required (see e.g. Table 1), and a direct alignment between construct and measurements obtained from the DDP is not always possible (see e.g. Table 2). For a direct construct, no processing is needed and measurements can be taken directly from the data present in the DDP (see e.g. Table 3).

A challenge in determining the operationalization of the construct in the DDPs, is that platforms not always fully adhere to the GDPR (M¨uller et al., 2019; Sørum & Presthus, 2020). This can resultin data occasionally not being present in a DDP while one would expect this data to be there. Therefore, it should always be checked if theoretical measurements are present in the DDPs. For RQ2, an approach to measure the construct ‘who responds most to someone’ can be to count the number of times the participant used WhatsApp’s quote functionality on someone else’s messages. However, WhatsApp does not provide data on the use of this functionality in their DDPs (see Figure 2), hence this way of measuring the construct can not be used in the study.
