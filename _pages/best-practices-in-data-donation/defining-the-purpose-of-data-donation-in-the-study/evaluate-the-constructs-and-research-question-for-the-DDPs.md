Once an overview of the candidate platforms is created, it can be evaluated how well each platform matches the defined constructs and the research question (see for example Step 3 in Tables 1 and 3). Based on this evaluation, it can be opted to select a single platform to continue the study with (e.g. Table 1). However, if after such an evaluation it is concluded that multiple platforms can provide equally suited DDPs or DDPs supplementing each other, the subsequent steps can also be executed for multiple platform (e.g. Table 2).
