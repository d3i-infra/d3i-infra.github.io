A data donation study design consists of two main elements: participant recruitment (section 4.1) and the study flow for the participant, also referred to as the participant flow (section 4.2). Participant recruitment comprises all actions and considerations in finding and inviting participants in the study. The participant flow consists of all elements a participant encounters while participating in the study. The exact elements of the participant flow can differ per study, as some elements are optional. Figure 4 summarizes the construction of the study design.

## Participant recruitment
Decisions on the population and the sample included in the data donation study are often based on the research question or topic, specified by the principal researcher. Data donation can be implemented in both qualitative and quantitative studies. It can serve the purpose of studying topics in more detail, or to make inferences to a population. For this latter purpose, a fitting sampling strategy for the study should be determined in order to end up with a representative study sample. For literature on sampling designs and related challenges, see Frankel (1983), Hibberts et al. (2012), Leeuw et al. (2008), Lohr (2021), and Weisberg (2009). 

When recruiting participants for data donation studies, there can be a misalignment between the individuals invited and accounts donated. For example, individuals might not own an account on the platform of interest, or conversely might own multiple accounts. Figure 5 illustrates how this misalignment could look for a single platform of example RQ2. In this example, the misalignment should be taken into account by allowing to donate multiple Instagram DDPs per participant. If participants are not allowed or requested to donate multiple DDPs when owning multiple accounts on the same platforms, the collected data can be incomplete and potentially biased.

Next, the use of incentives should be considered. Monetary incentives are considered best for keeping acceptable response rates in survey studies in general (Toepoel, 2012). Similar results are found for several versions of data donation studies (Kmetty et al., 2023; Silber et al., 2022), or for comparable data collection through smart phones (Haas et al., 2020). In several data donation studies that we were involved in, participants received monetary incentives (van Driel et al., 2022). However, the desired amount differs per context and is still subject to research (Struminskaya, 2022).

After deciding on the population and sample of interest, it is advised to get an overview on general characteristics of this population, such as age, opinion on research, and proficiency with technology. Based on these characteristics, elements of the participant flow might be tailored towards the target population. For example, instructions on obtaining the DDPs could be made available in multiple languages if the population of interest has multiple dominant languages.
