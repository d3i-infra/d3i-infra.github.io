Figure 4 summarizes elements that the participant flow can consists of. The exact elements of a participant flow and their order can differ over studies, as illustrated in figure 7. Most commonly, the participant flow commences with an invitation and information letter, explaining the study and the process of data donation to the participant. Next, a consent form is presented after which the participant has to provide their consent in order to continue their participation. Then, additional data collection methods can be administered, such as a questionnaire. The participant flow continues with instructions on requesting and downloading the DDP at the platform of interest. Once the DDP is obtained, local extraction and processing of the data can take place. Next, the participant can inspect the extracted data and optionally opt to edit or delete (part of) this data. The participant flow concludes with active consent to donate the extracted data. For constructing the participant flow, we have five recommendations.

 1. Make sure the entire participant flow is easy to follow for participants. Prevent excessive burdens. Participants might drop out of the study if the requested steps are perceived as too demanding or difficult. One approach to accomplish a participant flow not to be perceived as too demanding, is by tailoring the elements of the participant flow towards the population of interest. For example, if the target population scores high on illiteracy, instructions and explanations for every step of the participant flow should have easy and accessible language.

 2. Guarantee the privacy of the participant and communicate this clearly during the entire participant flow. In the invitation and consent form, rights of the participant and privacy assurance should be present. In addition, it can help to stress this explicitly at multiple moments during the participant flow. Participants not perceiving their privacy as guaranteed are more likely to not donate (Struminskaya, 2022; Struminskaya et al., 2020) or participate in data collection in general (Keusch et al., 2019; Sakshaug & Struminskaya, 2023). For instance, some participants in the WhatsApp pilot (example RQ 3) and the GSLH study (example RQ1) indicated that they felt their privacy was not guaranteed during the data processing. For some participants, this formed a reason to not participate in the study. Therefore, investing in the communication of the process and the privacy during the study can be valuable.

 3. Create clear and precise instructions on how to request and download the DDP. In creating the instructions for these steps, it should be noted that exact actions to obtain a DDP can differ over devices or over operating systems. Potential variations in these steps should be looked for, and should be taken into account in the instructions the participant is provided with. To illustrate, figure 6 shows how steps in obtaining WhatsApp chat DDPs differ for Android and Apple devices

 4. Account for the time it takes for a platform to provide a DDP, and be conscious of expiration times of a DDP. Platforms are obliged to comply with the data access request within 30 days (European Union, 2016). However, platforms differ strongly in how fast they provide the DDPs to their users, ranging from minutes to multiple days. For example, WhatsApp account information takes three days to be ready, while Google DDPs can take between an hour and three days. Communication about the waiting time should be clear and correct. Well-timed reminders can help keeping participants involved in the study. Additionally, expiration times of DDPs should be taken into account. Platforms only make DDPs available after request for a limited amount of time. These expiration times again differ over platforms. For example, Facebook and TikTok DDPs are only available for four days when ready, while WhatsApp account information can be downloaded for 30 days once ready. If these expiration times are not considered properly in the participant flow, participants might fail to obtain their DDPs and have to request them again, which might cause these participants to drop out of the study.

 5. Consider the device the participant uses during the participant flow. Depending on the platform, DDPs can only be requested and or downloaded on specific devices (e.g. WhatsApp chat files can only be obtained on the smartphone, while the Netflix DDP can only be obtained when using a computer). It should be clearly communicated to the participant what device(s) they are expected to use during the study. If participants are allowed to use multiple devices, instructions per device should be available.

## 4.2.1 Combining data donation with other approaches for data collection
Since data donation is a user-centric approach to collect digital trace data, the opportunity emerges to combine data donation with other methods for data collection, such as questionnaires. Including additional data collection methods can serve multiple purposes. First, alternative data collection methods can provide data that cannot be measured through data collection. For instance, opinions and psychological characteristics might be hard to measure through data donation, but can be measured through validated questionnaires. When including additional data collection methods with this purpose, it is recommended to always consider the perceived burden for participants, toprevent participants from dropping out of the study from perceiving the study procedure as too demanding.

Second, a questionnaire that is being administered prior to data donation, can help to provide more contextual information on who is (not) willing to participate in data donation studies, and who is (not) able to succesfully walk through the complete participant flow. Note that for the first aim, an alternative study flow as shown in part B of Figure 7 is recommended..

Third, including an additional data collection method gives the opportunity to measure a construct of interest in more than one way. For example, in the GSLH study (RQ1), travel behaviour can be measured through both digital traces and through questionnaire questions. Multiple measurements for a single construct can be combined, for example through a multitrait-multimethod model (Oberski et al., 2017). Such data integration can lead to improved measurements, and therefore in better validity of the data.
