In order to successfully prepare a data donation study, unique knowledge and expertise from several
different domains are required. We identified five domains of expertise deemed relevant for data
donation studies, represented by different roles:
1. An applied researcher with a substantive research question to be answered using data donation
is involved in all steps. They carry primary responsibility for the study.
2. An expert in the field of methodology can help to design the study in such a way that potential
bias in outcomes as a result of the study design are minimized.
3. A research engineer can develop the script that extract relevant features from the DDPs of
interest.
4. An IT expert can configure the server which hosts the study and data storage.
5. An expert on legal, privacy and ethical issues can be consulted at various steps of the study
workflow to ensure legal and ethical standards are met.
In Figure 1, it is summarized what domain experts are involved in each step of the workflow.
