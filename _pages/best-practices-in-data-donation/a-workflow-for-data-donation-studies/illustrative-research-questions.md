To illustrate the workflow and possible challenges that can arise at each step, three example research questions that can be answered with the use of data donation are used. These research questions vary in their level of processing of the extracted data prior to donation. The first research question is based on the study by Struminskaya (2022). Struminskaya et al. investigated data donation in a Dutch non-probability panel, concerning travel data. Data on the number of kilometers and hours traveled was extracted from Google Semantic Location History (GSLH) DDPs and processed to aggregate statistics, using PORT. The illustrative research question based on this study is the following:

Did travel behaviour in the Dutch population change during Covid-19? (1)

The second example research question is based on a study by Theo Araujo, investigating algorithmic profiling by social media platforms using a first iteration of D3I. The study extracted the inferred interest of participants as raw data from DDPs. The research question following from this example
is:

What interests do social media platforms infer from their users, and how do
these differ over platforms? (2)

The last example research question is based on the data donation study by Corten et al. (2022),
studying behaviour of participants ofWhatsApp groups. The study extracted data from two different
WhatsApp DDPs, and used the local processing of PORT to aggregate these data. This last research
question is:

What are the social network structures in group chats? (3)
