Once ethical approval for the study is obtained, the researcher should conduct a pilot version of the planned study. Conducting a pilot study helps in identifying potential problems that could not be found during the design phase, as a pilot study might form the first moment where all study elements act together. If the pilot study exposes flaws or problems in any of the study elements, these findings should be accounted for accordingly. If any changes to study elements turn out to be substantial, subsequent iterations of the pilot study can be considered. Once testing of the study has ensured the study quality is enough, the researcher is ready to conduct the study and start the  data collection.

The pilot study should resemble the actual study setting as much as possible in order to identify problems relevant for the actual study. Therefore, the participants of the pilot study should be representative for the actual study, while being a diverse group to ensure different study situations are encountered during the pilot. Additionally, in order to obtain more information on problems encountered by participants, subsequent contact with the pilot participants might be desirable. In pilot studies for the WhatsApp study and GSLH study (see section 2.3), the pilot samples consisted of colleagues, family, and friends recruited by the researcher. This way, recontacting participants for additional information on encountered problems was relatively easy. In order to ensure a diverse set of study situations, specific individuals were searched for to be included in the pilot study. For example, in the WhatsApp study, it was found that the date-time notation of messages differed over devices, settings, and operational systems. In order to account accordingly for the variations in notations, the researcher actively included participants in the pilot study with a variety in devices and settings of their devices. 

In order to obtain the required information on encountered problems during the pilot study, the exact procedure of the pilot study might deviate from the final studyâ€™s procedure. A separate ethical approval might be required for the pilot study. The ERB submission for the pilot study might then differ from the ERB submission for the full study. The expert on legal and ethical issues can guide the researcher with a second ERB submission.
