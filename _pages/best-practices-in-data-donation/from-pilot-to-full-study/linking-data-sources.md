The pilot study forms the first moment in the workflow where actual participant data is available to the researcher. If multiple data sources are included in the study design (e.g. both donated data and a questionnaire), the linkage of data belonging to the same participant should be arranged properly. Usually, linkage is ensured by including a piece of identical data in each data file belonging to the same participant. These data should be unique for every participant and function as a person identifier.

It is desirable to test the data linkage system on the collected pilot data, so encountered challenges can lead to improvement of the data linkage. Ideally, data linkage is automated before the final data collection, as studies including large samples make manual data linkage infeasible. However, an automatic way of linking data should be created with care, as this can be error prone. Finally, the privacy of the participants should be preserved at all times during the data linkage, and the data linkage should comply the legislation on personal data. Again, the expert on legal and privacy issues can guide the researcher with this.
