In our every day lives, we leave behind large amounts of digital traces. For example, we create
digital traces when browsing through social media, when sending an e-mail, when making bank
transactions, or when checking into public transportation. The term digital trace data refers to any
data that is created as a result of a digital interaction (Howison et al., 2011). These data can range
from a list of videos one watched on YouTube or Instagram, to complete personality profiles based
on previously used search terms on Google.
Digital trace data have valuable applications in social scientific research. For instance, they have
several advantages over data collected through self-reports (Sen et al., 2021; Stier et al., 2020).
First, digital trace data can provide more granular insights compared to self-reports. To illustrate,
van Driel et al. (2022) were able to study adolescentâ€™s Instagram use on a level of detail that
would not have been possible by means of self-reports. Second, digital trace data can provide
more objective measurements on sensitive topics than self-reports. For example, Jungherr (2015)
discusses how Twitter data potentially can be used to poll voting behavior. Third, digital trace data
can provide more objective measurements on topics that would require participant to recall their
memory when measured by self-reports. To illustrate, Ohme et al. (2021) found how digital trace
data provide more valid measurements for smartphone usage under Dutch adolescents compared to
self-reports. Likewise, Chi et al. (2020) show how location logs of mobile phones can provide more
precise measurement on migration events than currently used self-reports do.
Digital trace data can be obtained in several ways (Breuer et al., 2020). As a first method, web
