Prior to participation in any research, human subjects or participants have to provide an informed consent (Falagas et al., 2009; Neff, 2008). This usually is done by signing a consent form after being provided with thorough information on the concerning study. At least the participant should be informed on:

• the researcher’s identity; 
• the data being collected and what data is being used;
• the purpose of any data processing steps;
• the existence of the right to withdraw consent;
• confidentiality protection and the limitations thereof;
• time and nature of data storage;

Depending on the study population and type of data being collected, additional information might have to be provided as well. The legal expert should guide the researcher and ensure that participants are provided with all required information. Participants should be able to access this information at any moment during the study. Ensuring this continuous access can be attained by providing participants with a privacy policy, summarizing all required information on the rights of participants and potential risks of the study.
