In the early stages of a data donation study, the researcher should work towards submission to an Ethical Review Board (ERB) in order to obtain ethical approval. To guide a researcher in this process, consulting a legal expert is recommended. The exact process of obtaining ethical approval differs over academic institutions. Hence, it is advised to get in contact with legal experts of the institute of the principle investigator. Despite these possible differences over institutions, two elements required for any ethical submission are a data protection impact assessment and a consent form. A solid worked out idea of the study design (section 4), extraction script (section 5), and data donation tool configuration (section 6) can provide the required information to prepare the data protection impact assessment and consent form.

## Data protection impact assessment
A data protection impact assessment (DPIA) is expected or even mandatory to be carried out in every situation where personal data is collected or processed. Hence, for data donation studies a DPIA will always be required. A DPIA is documentation in which is described exactly how data will be collected, processed and stored (Demetzou, 2019; Hoofnagle et al., 2019). Furthermore, in a DPIA the researcher needs to reflect on situations in the data handling process where privacy of participants potentially could be violated. They need to argue how they minimize these potential risks. The DPIA mainly concerns the steps in the workflow of constructing the extraction script and configuring the data donation tool. The DPIA should be adjusted to the type of data that is collected in the study. Studies with data collection on sensitive topics require more risk protection than studies in which unidentifiable summary statistics are collected. The expert on legal, privacy and ethical issues can advise on taking measures fitting the type of data of interest.
