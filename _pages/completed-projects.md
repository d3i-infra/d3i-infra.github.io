# Behind the Screens: Exploring Netflix via Data Donations

**Principle investigators:** [Dennis Nguyen](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/DNguyen1) and [Karin van Es](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/KFvanEs) , Utrecht University

**Summary:** Netflix is often hailed as a disruptor of the traditional media industry, primarily due to its extensive data collection and analysis capabilities, as well as the effectiveness of its recommendation system. As a subscription-based service, Netflix has historically been reticent to share viewing data with external parties. However, under increasing public pressure and with the introduction of an ad-supported tier, Netflix has begun to show greater transparency. Nonetheless, as Lotz (2023) observes, “Netflix is only sharing information it wants to share.” This selective data sharing results in a reliance on Netflix's own narratives about aspects like binge-watching, content popularity and diversity, and the intricacies of their recommendation algorithms. Such narratives contribute to perpetuating myths, limiting our understanding of streaming platforms and obscuring their true disruptive impact (van Es 2023).

In the context of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Netflix subscribers can request their viewership data, which is provided in CSV files containing detailed information such as viewing activity, device usage, profile interactions, and playback events. Our Data Donations project engaged Netflix subscribers, inviting them to share this data for research purposes, along with completing a survey about their streaming preferences and perceptions of Netflix's recommender system. By analyzing data and survey responses from approximately 130 Netflix subscribers, this study conducts a critical examination of Netflix's assertions. It also sheds light on the potential limitations and inaccuracies in the data and metrics released by Netflix, underscoring the relevance of data donations.
