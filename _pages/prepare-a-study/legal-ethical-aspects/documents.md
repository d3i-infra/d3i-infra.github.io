Here we present the documents researchers should take note of. Some documents contain templates that researchers should fill in, in order for their research to be compliant with the GDPR.

* Why these documents?
    * For researchers
    * For participants
* Order of documents: background, consent, DPIA
* Procedure (Ethical Research Board and Data Protection Officer)


### Background
 
The GDPR affords a special regime with a degree of flexibility for public interest-driven scientific research projects that operate within an ethical framework, and that aim to grow society’s collective knowledge and well-being. The special regime entails consequences for the GDPR data processing principles including the lawfulness requirements and purpose limitation, and for some of the data subject access rights. It permits some derogations from the usual data controller obligations. This includes the presumption of compatibility of data processing of data for scientific research purposes that was collected in commercial and other contexts, provided that appropriate safeguards are in place. 

This flexibility is afforded on the assumption that research emerging within a framework of ethical oversight serves, as a principle, the public interest. The accountability principle remains key; it requires data controllers to assess and to manage responsibly the risks inherent to their research project. 

Data protection obligations generally scale up according to the risk that the processing activities may pose to the data subject, but the GDPR recognises that scientific research-related rights and interests can justify some derogation from some of GDPR’s general principles. The scope of derogation is however restricted, because the essence of the right to data protection must be preserved.

In this background document, we unpack who in the context of D3I projects is responsible for compliance with the GDPR, and how the derogations work in practice. We elaborate other important GDPR requirements for researchers to consider in separate documentation about “consent” and “Data Protection Impact Assessments”.

### Privacy policy

We offer researchers a privacy policy. A privacy policy must be in place for researchers whenever they decide to work within the context of data donation. We developed a privacy policy template for researchers which they should make specific to their research plans. We left spaces where the researcher can fill in and adjust the privacy policy before submitting it to the participant. 

Most importantly, the privacy policy informs the envisioned participants about the research for which a participant’s personal data will be processed and used. Before any processing and use of a participant’s personal data can start, the participant must be informed about the research plans, and give their specific, informed and unambiguous consent.  In other words, a participant’s specific, informed and unambiguous consent for the processing and use of their personal data is indispensable. The researcher must obtain a participant’s consent prior to the start of the data processing. 

The consent form in which the participant gives his or her specific, informed and unambiguous consent that the participant will sign can be found in [consent](/for-researchers/legal-ethical-aspects/documents#consent) (see the next section).

### Consent
 
The manual concerning GDPR’s consent is one of the crucial parts of D3I’s legal and ethical considerations researchers must pay attention to. Without a participant’s consent, researchers cannot lawfully process a participant’s personal data. To obtain lawful consent, researchers must pay attention to making that that consent is,

* specific, 
* informed and 
* unambiguous (see below how this can be achieved). 

We offer a consent manual in which we explain why consent is crucial for researchers who wish to process and use personal data from participants in their study. A participant’s well-informed and free consent is crucial for researchers.

We developed a consent form template for researchers that they can fill out before submitting it to the participant for obtaining consent. the participant must sign the document and return the document to the researcher (most likely via e-mail).

### Data protection impact assessment - DPIA

For researchers working in the context of D3I conducting a Data Protection Impact Assessment (hence: DPIA) is compelling. These researchers work with personal data from participants; these personal data often include special category personal data, which likely create vulnerabilities for participants. Special category personal data can for instance reveal a participant’s ethnicity, his or her political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership. Special category data also includes the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation. 

A DPIA is a process designed to identify and to help manage the risks to the rights of the participants whose data are going to be processed for a researcher’s research purposes. The researcher is responsible for assessing potential risks that may come with the processing of a participant’s personal data, and for taking appropriate mitigating measures to address these risks. Put differently, a DPIA is by no means a mere check-list for researchers to check their GDPR compliance – a DPIA requires researchers to meaningfully assess and address the risks created by the data processing towards the participants as well as towards other people, and to check their compliance with the GDPR. 
 
The outcome of the DPIA should be considered at the design stage of a research project. The DPIA is not only of importance in the design stage; the researcher must periodically review the DPIA and the processing it covers, at least when there is a change of the risk posed by processing the operation. 

The DPIA manual aims to inform and guide researchers carrying out a DPIA for their envisioned data processing.In the DPIA manual, we elaborate and explain how risks can be managed, and how these risks should, according to the GDPR, be responded to. 

The DPIA template contains questions to which the researcher should respond. The Ethical Research Board (ERB) of the faculty and/or university where the researcher has an appointment ultimately determines whether the researcher has identified the risks and whether he or she has taken adequate and appropriate mitigating measures. The ERB may also advise the researcher about taking steps towards achieving adequate and appropriate mitigating measures.
