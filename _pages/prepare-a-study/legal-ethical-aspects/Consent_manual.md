Consent manual

The manual concerning GDPR’s consent is (with the manual on the GDPR’s DPIA) a crucial part of D3I’s legal and ethical considerations researchers must pay attention to. Without a participant’s consent, researchers cannot lawfully process a participant’s personal data. To obtain lawful consent, researchers must pay attention to making that consent specific, informed and unambiguous (see below how this can be achieved).

The D3I-consent documentation involves: 
•	a manual about obtaining lawful consent for scientific researchers (this document)
•	a template for a privacy policy for participants (separate document to be filled by the researcher(s))
•	a template for an informed consent form for participants (separate document to be filled and signed by the researcher and to be signed by the participant)

This consent manual and templates will be used and tested throughout the three pilots in the D3I-project. The consent manual’s and templates’ design, its effectiveness and GDPR compliance will be analysed and where necessary be adjusted to the specific context of application in the D3I-research. These analyses will be based on the experiences collected during each of the pilots, after discussions with the University DPOs, data stewards and ERBs of the FSW departments. The documentation must also align with the technical architecture and operational aspects, and vice versa. 

•	We stay close to the current consent documentation as used by the UvA. 
•	After gaining experiences from the pilot, we may have to adjust the consent documentation where that is necessary to adequately safeguard the rights and interests of the data subjects (participants) and/or to clarify the documentation for the researchers (data controllers). 

1. Introduction

Generally, consent can only be lawful if a data subject is offered some form of meaningful control over the processing of their personal data, meaning that they are offered a genuine choice regarding accepting or declining the terms offered or declining them without detriment. 

When asking for consent, a researcher has the duty to assess whether that consent will meet all the requirements to obtain valid consent. If obtained in full compliance with the GDPR, consent is a tool that gives data subjects control over whether or not personal data concerning them will be processed. If not, the data subject’s control becomes illusory and consent will be an invalid basis for processing, rendering the processing activity unlawful. Inviting people to accept a data processing operation concerns the fundamental right of data subjects and is therefore subject to rigorous requirements. We introduce these next.


2. Consent in the GDPR

Article 4(11) of the GDPR defines consent as: 
●	any freely given, 
●	specific, 
●	informed, and unambiguous indication 
of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. 

We elaborate these elements next.

2.1 Freely given

The element “free” implies real and meaningful choice and control for data subjects. As a rule of thumb, the GDPR prescribes that if the data subject has no real choice, feels compelled to consent or will endure negative consequences if they do not consent, then consent will not be considered freely given, and thus be invalid. If consent is bundled up as a non-negotiable part of terms and conditions, it is presumed not to have been freely given. Accordingly, consent will not be free if the data subject is unable to refuse or withdraw his or her consent without detriment. 

The potential disbalance between the researcher and the data subject must also be considered (such disbalance is often present in relationships between employer-employee, or public organisation and citizen). In general terms, any element of inappropriate pressure or influence upon the data subject (which can be manifested in many different ways) which prevents a data subject from exercising their free will, shall render the consent invalid. An example might explain how consent works:

	“A mobile app for photo editing asks its users to have their GPS localisation activated for the
use of its services. The app also tells its users it will use the collected data for behavioural advertising purposes. Neither geo-localisation nor online behavioural advertising are necessary for the provision of the photo editing service and go beyond the delivery of the core service provided. Since users cannot use the app without consenting to these purposes, the consent cannot be considered as being freely given”. 

Some researchers offer participants small gifts for their participation – and thus for their consent. In relation to gifts for participation, it is important that the researcher demonstrates that it is possible to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.  For example, the researcher needs to prove that withdrawing consent does not lead to any costs for the data subject and thus no clear disadvantage for those withdrawing consent.

2.2 Specific
Consent of the data subject must be given in relation to one or more specific purposes and a data subject must have a choice in relation to each of them. That consent must be specific, aiming to ensure a degree of user control and transparency for the data subject. This requirement is closely linked to the requirement of informed consent (see below 2.3). At the same time, specific consent must be interpreted in line with the requirement for granularity to obtain 'free' consent as explained in 2.1.
In the context of scientific research, and thus for the D3I-research, the GDPR brings some flexibility to the degree of specification and granularity of consent: 

“It is often not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific research purposes at the time of data collection. Therefore, data subjects should be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of scientific research when in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research. Data subjects should have the opportunity to give their consent only to certain areas of research or parts of research projects to the extent allowed by the intended purpose.”

This does not dismiss the obligations related to the specificity requirement. As a rule, scientific research can only include personal data based on consent if they have a well-described purpose. For situations where purposes for data processing within a scientific research project cannot be specified at the outset, Recital 33 allows as an exception that the purpose may be described at a more general level. 

Note however that the strict conditions that apply to special category data (ethnic origin, religion and beliefs, sexual preference etc.) will still be subject to a stricter interpretation, as special category data also requires a high degree of scrutiny (i.e., more weighty reasons for the processing of that data).

2.3 Informed

The GDPR requires that consent must be informed. The requirement of transparency is one of GDPR's data processing principles, closely related to the principles of fairness and lawfulness. Providing appropriate information to data subjects prior to obtaining consent is essential to enable them to take informed decisions, understand what they are agreeing to, and exercise their right to withdraw their consent. 
If the researcher does not provide accessible information, user control becomes illusory and consent will be an invalid basis for processing. The consequence of not complying with the requirements for informed consent is that consent will be invalid and the researcher will be in breach of the GDPR.

For consent to be informed, it is necessary to inform the data subject of certain elements that are crucial to make an informed choice. Therefore, the EDPB is of the opinion that at least the following information is required for obtaining valid consent:
●	the researcher’s identity;
●	the purpose of each of the processing operations for which consent is sought;
●	what (type of) data will be collected and used;
●	the existence of the right to withdraw consent;
●	information about the use of the data for automated decision-making in accordance with Article 22 (2)(c) GDPR where relevant; and
●	on the possible risks of data transfers outside the EU due to absence of adequate data protection.


2.4 Unambiguous indication of wishes

Consent requires a statement from the data subject, or a clear affirmative act, which means that it must always be given through an active motion or declaration. It must be obvious that the data subject has consented to the particular processing. It means that the data subject must have taken a deliberate action to consent to the processing.  Consent can be collected through a written or (a recorded) oral statement, including by electronic means. Written statements can come in many shapes and sizes that could be compliant with the GDPR.

Consent in the context of D3I-related research: little room for derogation 
-	Obtaining valid consent/explicit consent in the scientific research context
o	The requirement of consent being “specific”: there is a restricted scope of derogation where the research purpose is concerned (specificity of the research purpose in research contexts can be a bit less specific, see the background document on the GDPR). 
o	Make a comprehensible research plan available to participants.
o	Consider visualisation of the data processing if you want participants to take a reasoned decision about what data they can delete.
o	Special contact person (Finnish personal data act ).
o	Withdrawal of consent: no exception for scientific research.
o	Make withdrawal as easy as giving consent (prescribed by the GDPR).
o	Consider the use of pseudonymisation and anonymisation techniques.

2.5	Other considerations that are relevant for D3I-researchers:

How do you inform the participant (the data subject)?

a.	By way of a privacy policy that was adjusted to the participant’s level of comprehension.
b.	By providing them a link to and/or reference to the University’s privacy statement.
c.	By the organisation that is the source of the personal data obtained consent in a GDPR compliant manner will be informed.

In the context of D3I, we inform participants according to (a) and (b). Littera (c) does not apply because the personal data is retrieved from the participants themselves, and not via third parties.

Information that must be provided to the data subject (participant in D3I-projects) under Article 13 GDPR:

The GDPR obliges the researcher to properly inform the data subject (participant) about the research. As in the context of D3I data are retrieved from the participants themselves, the following (i) general and (ii) GDPR-specific questions need to be answered by the researcher:

(i) Generic considerations for researchers to respond to (and that are embedded in the privacy policy template):
1.	Do participants know that you as researcher are processing their personal data for your specified research purpose? 
2.	How are participants informed about this? For example: by way of a consent form and a privacy policy? 
3.	If Informed consent is sought from participants for the processing: where are the consent forms stored? 
4.	If Informed consent is sought from participants for processing: how can the participant withdraw consent at a later date? Withdrawal has consequences for your research: according to Article 7 (3) GDPR, the withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before it was withdrawn. 
5.	Does the processing provide opportunities for data subjects (participants) to request/view/edit/delete his/her personal data themselves (think of self-service functionalities or procedures)? How are these made comprehensible and manageable for participants to convey them some actual control over aspects of the processing of their personal data?
6.	Are the personal data also used for other business processes or purposes than those for which they were originally collected? Or do you expect that this could happen? Also 

(ii) GDPR-specific requirements ; the responses will be part of the privacy policy that informs the participants: 

1.	The researcher must, before or at the time when personal data are collected, provide the participant with all of the following information:
a.	the identity and contact details of the researcher and, if that applies, their representative;
b.	the contact details of the data protection officer;
c.	the purpose of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing (in the context of D3I, the legal basis for processing is “consent”);
d.	if this applies, the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data (i.e., whether data transfers to a third-party can occur);
e.	if this applies, the fact that the researcher intends to transfer the personal data to a country outside the EU (where the GDPR does not apply and risks to the data processing can emerge).

2.	In addition, researcher provides the participant at the time where personal data are collected, with information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing:
a.	the period for which the data will be stored;
b.	the existence of the participant’s right to request access from the researcher to their personal data held by the researcher, and the participant’s rights to rectification of their personal data or restriction of processing concerning him or her, and the right to port their data to another data controller which can be for instance a researcher at another university (“subject access rights” ). A participant’s right to have their data erased is, however, restricted in the context of scientific research ;
c.	where the processing is based on consent or explicit consent, the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal;
d.	the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority (in the Netherlands: the Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens);
e.	where that applies, the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling (as defined in Art. 22(1) GDPR). The researcher must in these situations provide the participant with meaningful information about the logic involved, and the significance and consequences of such processing for the data subject (participant); 

3.	Where the researcher intends to use the data for a purpose different than that for which the data was originally collected, the researcher provides the participant prior to that further processing with information about that other purpose, and with any other relevant information mentioned in 1 and 2. In the context of D3i, researchers may have to consider, for example, the use of the personal data for follow-up research. If that applies, the researcher must inform the participant.

3.	GDPR text

Article 6(1)(a) GDPR Consent as lawful ground for data processing

Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that […] the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.

Article 7 GDPR Conditions for consent

(1) Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data.

(2) If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.

(3) The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.

(4) When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.
