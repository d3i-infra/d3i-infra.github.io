# Digital Data Donation Infrastructure
Welcome at the Digital Data Donation Infrastructure (in short ‘D3I’). 

Do you want to collect digital trace data in a way that is transparent to your research participants 
and which preserves their privacy as much as possible? Then data donation is your answer! 

On this website, you can find out how data donation exactly works. Our PORT software to configure your own 
data donation study is available free and open source. From July 2023 onwards, you will also be able to 
use a pre-configured instance of the software available through SURF. Furthermore, we provide you with 
everything you need as a researcher conducting a data donation study, and have an archive of all previous 
data donation studies using PORT. 

Enjoy and please reach out to one of our team members in case you have any questions or comments!
