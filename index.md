Welcome at datadonation.eu, the website of [D3I](/d3i/), a project funded by [PDI-SSH](https://pdi-ssh.nl/en/). datadonation.eu aims to bring together an international community of researchers interested in using data donation for research. 

Do you want to collect digital trace data in a way that is transparent to your research participants and which preserves their privacy as much as possible? Then data donation is your answer! On this website, you can find out more about [data donation](/data-donation/), how to prepare a data donation study, and how to use our data donation software, PORT. 

Enjoy and please reach out to one of our [team](/team/) members in case you have any questions or comments!
